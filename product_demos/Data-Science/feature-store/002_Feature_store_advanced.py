# MAGIC # Feature store Travel Agency recommendation - Advanced
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this advanced demo, we’ll explore more powerful capabilities of Feature Engineering in Databricks Unity Catalog, building on top of the previous introductory notebook.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We’ll continue with the same use case — a Travel Agency Recommender Model — which aims to increase revenue by personalizing travel and hotel offers based on the likelihood that each user will make a purchase.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This version goes deeper into temporal and online feature management, demonstrating how Databricks enables both accurate offline training and real-time serving.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What You’ll Learn
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Build advanced features across multiple Feature Tables**  
# MAGIC   Create user-level and destination-level features, including rolling aggregates and time-aware statistics.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Introduce a timestamp key for point-in-time lookups**  
# MAGIC   Ensure that features used during training reflect only information available up to that point in time — eliminating data leakage.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Combine multiple feature tables using `FeatureLookup`**  
# MAGIC   Automatically join features from different entities (e.g., users and destinations) during training.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Train and register a model using the Feature Engineering Client**  
# MAGIC   Use feature-enriched data to train a custom model, log it with feature lineage, and register it in Unity Catalog.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Publish Online Feature Tables for real-time inference/serving**  
# MAGIC   Sync your Delta Tables to Online Feature Stores powered by Databricks Lakebase — enabling low-latency access to features for serving endpoints or external applications.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC  By the end of this notebook, you’ll understand how to move from batch feature engineering to a fully automated, real-time ML system — where your models and feature pipelines stay consistent, governed, and production-ready within Unity Catalog.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this second example, we'll introduce more tables and new features calculated with window functions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To simplify updates & refresh, we'll split them in 2 tables:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **User features**: contains all the features for a given user in a given point in time (location, previous purchases if any, tenure days etc)
# MAGIC * **Destination features**: data on the travel destination for a given point in time (interest tracked by the number of clicks & impression)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Point-in-time support for feature tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks Feature Store supports use cases that require point-in-time correctness.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The data used to train a model often has time dependencies built into it. In our case, because we are adding rolling-window features, our Feature Table will contain data on all the dataset timeframe. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When we build our model, we must consider only feature values up until the time of the observed target value. If you do not explicitly take into account the timestamp of each observation, you might inadvertently use feature values measured after the timestamp of the target value for training. This is called “data leakage” and can negatively affect the model’s performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Time series feature tables include a timestamp key column that ensures that each row in the training dataset represents the latest known feature values as of the row’s timestamp. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In our case, this timestamp key will be the `ts` field, present in our 2 feature tables.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### Calculating the features
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's calculate the aggregated features from the vacation purchase logs for destinations and users. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The user features capture the user profile information such as past purchased price. Because the booking data does not change very often, it can be computed once per day in batch.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The destination features include popularity features such as impressions and clicks, as well as pricing features such as price at the time of booking.

# MAGIC ### Training the Model with Custom scikit-learn Pipelines
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this session we’ll manually train a **custom scikit-learn classification model** using the features retrieved from the Feature Store.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We’ll build a preprocessing and modeling pipeline that includes:
# MAGIC - A `ColumnTransformer` to handle both numerical and categorical features
# MAGIC - Standardization and one-hot encoding for consistent feature scaling
# MAGIC - A set of classification models include `LightGBMClassifier`, `Random Forest` as our core algorithms for predicting travel purchases
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout the process, we’ll use **MLflow tracking** and the **Feature Engineering Client** to:
# MAGIC - Train multiple models with model selection on the best model
# MAGIC - Log our best performed model, parameters, and metrics  
# MAGIC - Capture full feature lineage from the Feature Store  
# MAGIC - Register the trained model in **Unity Catalog** for governance and deployment
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This approach provides full control over feature engineering, preprocessing, and model selection, and maintaining the same reproducibility and lineage benefits.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks now supports **Online Feature Stores**, providing a fully managed and low-latency key–value lookup service for real-time machine learning applications.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this advanced demo, we publish our offline feature tables (for example, `user_features_advanced` and `destination_features_advanced`) to an **online feature store** using the `FeatureEngineeringClient.publish_table()` API.  
# MAGIC Once published, these tables are continuously synchronized with their Delta source tables, ensuring that your real-time applications always access the latest feature values.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With the online tables in place, we can:
# MAGIC - Create a **Feature Spec** to define which features should be fetched for inference  
# MAGIC - Build a **Feature Serving Endpoint** that exposes these features through an API  
# MAGIC - Connect the endpoint to our **Unity Catalog–registered ML model**, allowing it to automatically fetch the latest features for each incoming request
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This architecture enables **end-to-end real-time prediction**, where feature retrieval and model inference happen within milliseconds — all governed and tracked within Unity Catalog.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC The capacity options correspond to different performance tiers "CU_1", "CU_2", "CU_4", and "CU_8". Each capacity unit allocates about 16GB of RAM to the database instance, along with all associated CPU and local SSD resources.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Publish a feature table to an online store
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Prerequisites for publishing to online stores
# MAGIC All feature tables (with or without time series) must meet these requirements before publishing:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Primary key constraint**: Required for online store publishing
# MAGIC - **Non-nullable primary keys**: Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values
# MAGIC - **Change Data Feed enabled**: Required for online store sync. See [Enable change data feed](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed#enable)
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ## 5. Real-time Serving Scenarios
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are two main ways to operationalize your features and models:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Option 1. Feature Serving Endpoint (for external applications)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Use when your application or model runs outside of Databricks, but still needs low-latency access to features.
# MAGIC Databricks will automatically keep the online feature tables in sync, and your application can fetch the latest features via a REST API.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Option 2. Model Serving Endpoint (for in-Databricks inference)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Use when your model is deployed in Databricks Model Serving.
# MAGIC The model automatically performs online feature lookups from the published tables — no extra feature-joining logic required.
# MAGIC This enables true real-time inference with consistent feature definitions across training, batch scoring, and serving.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ### Option 1. Feature Serving Endpoint (for external applications)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Option 1 - Step 1: Create a FeatureSpec
# MAGIC A FeatureSpec is a user-defined set of features and functions. You can combine features and functions in a FeatureSpec. FeatureSpecs are stored in and managed by Unity Catalog and appear in Catalog Explorer.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Option 1 - Create a FeatureSpec
# Create a Feature Spec that combines both user & destination online features
feature_spec_name = f"{catalog}.{db}.travel_purchase_feature_spec"

# MAGIC ## Summary 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this advanced demo, we’ve built a complete feature lifecycle using Databricks Feature Store — from creating timestamp-aware user and destination features to training and deploying a real-time recommendation model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With Unity Catalog integration, every feature and model is fully governed and traceable. You can now see exactly which model depends on which feature table, and trace it back to the notebook or job that created it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By registering the model through `fe.log_model()`, we’ve ensured automatic feature lookups during inference — whether the model runs in batch jobs or is served in real time through Databricks Model Serving.
# MAGIC This guarantees that the same features used in training are consistently retrieved for inference, eliminating data leakage and mismatches.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Next Step: Spark Declarative Feature Pipelines with Lakeflow

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next, we’ll demonstrate how to build and manage feature tables declaratively using Lakeflow pipelines.
# MAGIC With a simple Python decorator like `@dp.materialized_view`, Databricks can automatically orchestrate feature dependencies, manage schema evolution, and handle refresh schedules — unifying feature engineering and pipeline orchestration within a single framework.
